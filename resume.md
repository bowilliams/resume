### Experience

**Gamalon**

*Vice President of Engineering* __November 2019 - February 2020__

* Shipped the first version of Gamalon's Chat product for AI-driven marketing and sales conversation in collaboration with product and machine learning leadership
* Led four software engineers, one data scientist/technical product owner, and one business/data analyst manager with four business/data analyst reports of her own

**Spotify**

*Director of Engineering* __August 2018 - November 2019__

*Senior Engineering Manager* __September 2013 - August 2018__

Leading engineering teams across Spotify since the acquisition of The Echo Nest in 2014. Notable accomplishments include:

* Voice- initial lead team created a mission/vision for the future of voice at Spotify. I built an implementation plan and team for this vision. Started with 2 engineers + 1 research. I staffed a combined team of 30+ through a mix of internal and external recruiting and hiring. I created a leadership group, focusing on mitigation of initial risks, and facilitated the creation of roadmaps in major functional areas (in-house NLU, partner integrations, design & UX research, and ads). As the tech product area lead (a manager-of-managers role) for voice in our User Engagement mission, my team launched Spotify's voice feature in iOS and Android, and made major improvements to how we fulfill requests on partner platforms.
* The Echo Nest integration- I managed a team of engineers through a difficult and complicated acquisition, finding a home for our work and products with a very high retention rate. 100% of my original team was retained at Spotify three years after the acquisition, and 50% were still with Spotify after five years.
* Shipping software- in addition to my work with the voice program, my previous team shipped 
	- listener affinity (favorite artists/tracks) for all Spotify users at scale
	- "clusters" - the groupings of artists in a listener's taste which produce Daily Mix stations
	- the annual Year in Music (later rebraded as Wrapped) playlists
	- and other features focused on reflecting a fan's musical taste back to them by providing ready-made playlists and radio stations focused around their favorite music
* Bootstrapped Machine Learning in Spotify Boston-
When we decided we needed to grow a machine learning team and capability in our Boston office, I made the initial three hires to form the core of the team, managed the integration of those hires into their teams, and helped to draft the job description and select a machine learning engineering manager to take over this duty once the initial team was in place.
* Growing impactful, effective employees- people on my team have led local GCP migration efforts, mission-level diversity and inclusion strategy and implementation, and a successful cross-functional marketing campaign with major impact on listening time.
* Managing Managers- I promoted two internal candidates (both first-time managers) and hired one external candidate in my role as Director of the voice product area.

**Progressive Solutions**

*Director of Engineering* __May 2011 - September 2013__

I was the second engineering hire on a new team at Progressive Solutions. As the company expanded with more e-commerce and software oriented business, I was brought in to build a foundation of solid engineering practices. Led the development and improvement of our process. 

* Co-designed (with CTO) a RESTful API implemented in .Net MVC for creating and ordering personalized documents.
* Developed a task management system in Python based on celery/RabbitMQ/Redis to accept orders of personalized documents, marshal final output asynchronously (depending on load, could take up to eight hours), and deliver the order to internal or third party fulfillment systems in multiple formats. 
* Led the project to move our children's product e-commerce site (www.frecklebox.com) off of an unstable and hard to scale integration with a third-party document personalization product and on to our own RESTful API. 
* Similarly, led the project to move our B2B stationery ordering site (www.stationeryhq.com) off of the same package and on to nopCommerce (C#/MVC e-commerce platform) and our own API for document personalization

**Brainshark**

*Engineering Manager - Support and Services* __April 2010 - April 2011__

Brainshark is a market leader in online presentation and training- they take uploaded PowerPoint presentations, provide an easy UI for adding notes and audio, and create videos suitable for online or mobile viewing. I was hired to solve an internal management and resources problem- support escalations and services engagements were draining engineering resources and causing delays in the release schedule. I was asked to serve as a liaison between engineering, sales, and support, and to build a team so that escalations and services projects could be done outside of the product team. Inherited an IT resource to manage application support and release engineering and a database administrator, and also hired two .Net/JavaScript skilled engineers, one who solved support cases and fixed bugs, and one who led services implementation.

**Bitstream**

*Pageflex Services Lead Engineer / R&D Engineer* __August 2006 - April 2010__

Project Lead Engineer in the Technical Solutions & Services department of Pageflex. 

* Responsible for full cycle (initiating contact with customers, requirements gathering, project estimation and pricing, implementation, testing, and support) development of customizations to Pageflex Storefront, a web-to-print gateway for variable document customization and personalization. These included both back-end integrations with the product API as well as front end creation of new workflows. 
* Developed integrations to a number of enterprise-level software packages (automation & MIS) for clients. Educated team on emerging technologies and led efforts to improve process and tools. 

In July 2009 I moved to the R&D team, where I became responsible for improving current products as well as developing new offerings.

**Banta**

*Software Engineer / Software Engineer II / Sr. Technical Application Architect* __July 2000 - August 2006__

Division was a rapid application development, team-based environment with project life cycles ranging from four hours to four months.
